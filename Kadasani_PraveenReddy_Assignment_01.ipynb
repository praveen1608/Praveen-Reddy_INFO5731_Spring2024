        "Overall assignment was good. Question 1 was easy to work and took a reasonale amount of time. Coming to questions 2 and 3 , they were good to make a person think. I got failed more than once while doing these questions. Question number 4 , I tried to do it without inbuilt functions , but got failed several times at step b and c. So I used functions to do that question. Question 5 really tested my patience while loading the dataset. All questions are able to make myself work on functions. The challenging part is question number 4, where I spent a lot of time. I enjoyed working in new tool , previously I used Jupiter notebooks. And provided time was absolutley enough. Assignments like this will help us a lot in practicing.\n"
