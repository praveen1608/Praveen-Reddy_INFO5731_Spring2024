First I thought of collecting reviews from amazon, but endup in choosing the movie reviews. There are not much challenges I faced this assignment, but worked on csv files and how to download it and store it etc. I really enjoyed in text cleaning part, like I used to observe the results after the step and how the effects were after conducting a particular step. The time provided for the assignment is perfectly sufficient. Students with more than 9 credits may have faced some time issues, but it was sufficient.\n"
