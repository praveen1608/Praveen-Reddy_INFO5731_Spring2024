The model has three formative constructs: intermittent discontinuance (INDI), short break discontinuance (SBDi), and suspended discontinuance (SUDi). The constructs are measured by multiple items. The table shows the weights, t-values, loadings, and VIF values for each item. The weights represent the strength of the relationship between the item and the construct. The t-values represent the significance of the relationship. The loadings represent the correlation between the item and the construct. The VIF values represent the amount of collinearity between the items.\\n\\nAll of the items have significant weights and loadings, and the VIF values are all below 3.3, which indicates that there is no collinearity between the items. This suggests that the model is valid and reliable.\",\n          \" The table shows the results of a study that examined the relationships between various factors and employee resistance to XR adoption. The hypotheses tested in the study are listed in the first column, followed by the relationship between the variables in the second column. The third column shows the effect size of the relationship, and the fourth column indicates whether the hypothesis was supported or not.\\n\\nThe results show that there is a significant negative relationship between expected employee resistance and XR adoption intention, as well as between expected employee resistance and perceived organizational value of XR. This means that as expected employee resistance increases, XR adoption intention and perceived organizational value of XR decrease.\\n\\nThere is also a significant positive relationship between perceived organizational value of XR and organizational XR adoption intention. This means that as perceived organizational value of XR increases, organizational XR adoption intention also increases.\\n\\nAdditionally, the results show that there is a significant negative relationship between employee technology use skills and expected employee resistance to XR. This means that as employee technology use skills increase, expected employee resistance to XR decreases.\\n\\nThere is also a significant negative relationship between organizational support and expected employee resistance to XR, as well as between organizational support and perceived organizational value of XR. This means that as organizational support increases, expected employee resistance to XR and perceived organizational value of XR decrease.\\n\\nHowever, the results did not support the hypotheses that there would be a significant relationship between external support and expected employee resistance to XR, between mimetic pressure and perceived organizational value of XR, between compatibility and expected employee resistance to XR, between compatibility and perceived organizational value of XR, between triability and expected employee resistance to XR, or between triability and perceived organizational value of XR.\\n\\nOverall, the results of the study provide some evidence to support the idea that employee resistance to XR adoption is influenced by a variety of factors, including expected employee resistance, perceived organizational value of XR, employee technology use skills, and organizational support.\",\n          \" | Task-related features | Task completed | Task not completed | P |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| No. recipe suggestions (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 5.85 (4.431) | 7.33 (5.743) | 0.525 |\\n| No. correct recipe suggestions (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 4.19 (3.511) | 5.33 (5.433) | 0.863 |\\n| Percentage of correct recipe suggestions (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 79.87 (32.145) | 71.86 (43.721) | 0.362 |\\n| Recipe criteria: narrativeness of KIM (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 4.251 (28.643) | 59.52 (19.298) | 0.041 |\\n| Recipe criteria: ingredients (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 0.35 (0.497) | 0.64 (0.497) | 0.034 |\\n| Recipe criteria: difficulty level (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 0.55 (0.500) | 0.64 (0.497) | 0.514 |\\n| Time spent in conversation in minutes (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 2.69 (1.338) | 3.00 (1.240) | 0.304 |\\n| Text features |  |  |  |\\n| No. messages from KIM (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 14.16 (5.637) | 17.57 (7.272) | 0.051 |\\n| No. messages from the user (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 9.21 (3.452) | 10.93 (4.552) | 0.047 |\\n| No. messages from KIM * user (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 23.37 (8.917) | 28.50 (10.219) | 0.035 |\\n| No. words from KIM (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 148.21 (136.762) | 210.43 (143.872) | 0.038 |\\n| No. words from the user (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 362.16 (195.704) | 400.43 (279.203) | 0.988 |\\n| No. words from KIM * user (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 22.51 (13.975) | 22.51 (13.975) | 1.000 |\\n| No. words from KIM/user (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 384.67 (202.237) | 960.87 (1386.526) | 0.789 |\\n| No. emojis used by KIM (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 1.47 (1.488) | 0.61 (1.488) | 0.173 |\\n| No. emojis used by the user (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 1.47 (1.488) | 1.57 (1.828) | 0.828 |\\n| Characteristics of conversation ability |  |  |  |\\n| No. conversation restarts by KIM (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 1.21 (0.426) | 1.22 (0.516) | 0.983 |\\n| Correct greeting by KIM (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 0.98 (0.142) | 0.79 (0.426) | 0.731 |\\n| Evaluation |  |  |  |\\n| Satisfaction of the user (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 4.34 (1.477) | 3.31 (2.288) | 0.047 |\\n| Perceived naturalness of KIM (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 4.48 (1.359) | 4.26 (1.359) | 0.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The VIF values represent the amount of collinearity between the items.\\n\\nAll of the items have significant weights and loadings, and the VIF values are all below 3.3, which indicates that there is no collinearity between the items.

The hypotheses tested in the study are listed in the first column, followed by the relationship between the variables in the second column. The third column shows the effect size of the relationship, and the fourth column indicates whether the hypothesis was supported or not.\\n\\nThe results show that there is a significant negative relationship between expected employee resistance and XR adoption intention, as well as between expected employee resistance and perceived organizational value of XR. This means that as expected employee resistance increases, XR adoption intention and perceived organizational value of XR decrease.\\n\\nThere is also a significant positive relationship between perceived organizational value of XR and organizational XR adoption intention. This means that as perceived organizational value of XR increases, organizational XR adoption intention also increases.\\n\\nAdditionally, the results show that there is a significant negative relationship between employee technology use skills and expected employee resistance to XR. This means that as employee technology use skills increase, expected employee resistance to XR decreases.\\n\\nThere is also a significant negative relationship between organizational support and expected employee resistance to XR, as well as between organizational support and perceived organizational value of XR. This means that as organizational support increases, expected employee resistance to XR and perceived organizational value of XR decrease.\\n\\nHowever, the results did not support the hypotheses that there would be a significant relationship between external support and expected employee resistance to XR, between mimetic pressure and perceived organizational value of XR, between compatibility and expected employee resistance to XR, between compatibility and perceived organizational value of XR, between triability and expected employee resistance to XR, or between triability and perceived organizational value of XR.\\n\\nOverall, the results of the study provide some evidence to support the idea that employee resistance to XR adoption is influenced by a variety of factors, including expected employee resistance, perceived organizational value of XR, employee technology use skills, and organizational support.\",\n          \" | Task-related features | Task completed | Task not completed | P |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| No. recipe suggestions (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 5.85 (4.431) | 7.33 (5.743) | 0.525 |\\n| No. correct recipe suggestions (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 4.19 (3.511) | 5.33 (5.433) | 0.863 |\\n| Percentage of correct recipe suggestions (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 79.87 (32.145) | 71.86 (43.721) | 0.362 |\\n| Recipe criteria: narrativeness of KIM (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 4.251 (28.643) | 59.52 (19.298) | 0.041 |\\n| Recipe criteria: ingredients (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 0.35 (0.497) | 0.64 (0.497) | 0.034 |\\n| Recipe criteria: difficulty level (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 0.55 (0.500) | 0.64 (0.497) | 0.514 |\\n| Time spent in conversation in minutes (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 2.69 (1.338) | 3.00 (1.240) | 0.304 |\\n| Text features |  |  |  |\\n| No. messages from KIM (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 14.16 (5.637) | 17.57 (7.272) | 0.051 |\\n| No. messages from the user (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 9.21 (3.452) | 10.93 (4.552) | 0.047 |\\n| No. messages from KIM * user (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 23.37 (8.917) | 28.50 (10.219) | 0.035 |\\n| No. words from KIM (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 148.21 (136.762) | 210.43 (143.872) | 0.038 |\\n| No. words from the user (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 362.16 (195.704) | 400.43 (279.203) | 0.988 |\\n| No. words from KIM * user (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 22.51 (13.975) | 22.51 (13.975) | 1.000 |\\n| No. words from KIM/user (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 384.67 (202.237) | 960.87 (1386.526) | 0.789 |\\n| No. emojis used by KIM (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 1.47 (1.488) | 0.61 (1.488) | 0.173 |\\n| No. emojis used by the user (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 1.47 (1.488) | 1.57 (1.828) | 0.828 |\\n| Characteristics of conversation ability |  |  |  |\\n| No. conversation restarts by KIM (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 1.21 (0.426) | 1.22 (0.516) | 0.983 |\\n| Correct greeting by KIM (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 0.98 (0.142) | 0.79 (0.426) | 0.731 |\\n| Evaluation |  |  |  |\\n| Satisfaction of the user (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 4.34 (1.477) | 3.31 (2.288) | 0.047 |\\n| Perceived naturalness of KIM (mean \\u00b1 std.) | 4.48 (1.359) | 4.26 (1.359) | 0.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Author Summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 205,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"To facilitate our focus group discussion, we meticulously framed our research objectives to provide clear guidance on the purpose of our study, as outlined in Table 6.

For Hypothesis 1, participants engaged in conversations addressing questions such as \\\"Could you share your thoughts on why shareholders generally react positively to AI implementation in B2B marketing?\\\" and \\\"What specific benefits or expectations do you associate with AI adoption in B2B marketing?\\\" Hypothesis 2 prompted discussions with questions such as \\\"From your perspective, how do industry dynamics and concerns affect your perception of AI adoption in B2B marketing?\\\" and \\\"Do you believe that firms in more dynamic industries have unique considerations when it comes to AI implementation? Please elaborate.\\\" Hypothesis 3 guided participants to respond to queries like \\\"What challenges or complexities do you perceive in firms with more complex customer bases when implementing AI in B2B marketing?\\\" and \\\"Could you provide examples of situations where shareholders may have concerns about AI adoption in such firms?\\\".\",\n          \"Survey Items for Performance Expectancy.\",\n          \"As Table 6 shows, to analyze the mediation effects of disclosure intentions between privacy concerns and purchase intentions, we used two tools: SPSS Process and AMOS.

We concluded that there were indirect effects of disclosure intentions between privacy concerns and purchase intentions because the interval between the lower level of confidence interval (BootLLCI) and the upper level of confidence interval (BootULCI) did not include zero (see Table B.3). The results of the model fit (GFI = 0.98, AGFI = 0.96, CFI = 0.99, RMSEA = 0.03) indicated that there was good model fit between the proposed model and the data, such that the data does not require re-specification (see Table B.4).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

We concluded that there were indirect effects of disclosure intentions between privacy concerns and purchase intentions because the interval between the lower level of confidence interval (BootLLCI) and the upper level of confidence interval (BootULCI) did not include zero (see Table B.3). The results of the model fit (GFI = 0.98, AGFI = 0.96, CFI = 0.99, RMSEA = 0.03) indicated that there was good model fit between the proposed model and the data, such that the data does not require re-specification (see Table B.4).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Cosine_Similarity Score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.14368444431712876,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.5133287545573182,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 206,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.12453818453105654,\n          0.047250510740500976,\n          0.1649948738305144\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

We concluded that there were indirect effects of disclosure intentions between privacy concerns and purchase intentions because the interval between the lower level of confidence interval (BootLLCI) and the upper level of confidence interval (BootULCI) did not include zero (see Table B.3). The results of the model fit (GFI = 0.98, AGFI = 0.96, CFI = 0.99, RMSEA = 0.03) indicated that there was good model fit between the proposed model and the data, such that the data does not require re-specification (see Table B.4).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Cosine_Similarity Score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.14368444431712876,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.5133287545573182,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 206,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.12453818453105654,\n          0.047250510740500976,\n          0.1649948738305144\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ROUGE-WE\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"float32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 214,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.6227190494537354,\n          0.8188688158988953,\n          0.5739125609397888\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"BertScore\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.024955950098645263,\n        \"min\": 0.7403626441955566,\n        \"max\": 0.8940659165382385,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 214,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8206648826599121,\n          0.8106594681739807,\n          0.7824459671974182\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

We concluded that there were indirect effects of disclosure intentions between privacy concerns and purchase intentions because the interval between the lower level of confidence interval (BootLLCI) and the upper level of confidence interval (BootULCI) did not include zero (see Table B.3). The results of the model fit (GFI = 0.98, AGFI = 0.96, CFI = 0.99, RMSEA = 0.03) indicated that there was good model fit between the proposed model and the data, such that the data does not require re-specification (see Table B.4).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Cosine_Similarity Score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.14368444431712876,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.5133287545573182,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 206,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.12453818453105654,\n          0.047250510740500976,\n          0.1649948738305144\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ROUGE-WE\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"float32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 214,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.6227190494537354,\n          0.8188688158988953,\n          0.5739125609397888\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"BertScore\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.024955950098645263,\n        \"min\": 0.7403626441955566,\n        \"max\": 0.8940659165382385,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 214,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8206648826599121,\n          0.8106594681739807,\n          0.7824459671974182\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"BLEU Score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.17500341727587995,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.5495495495495496,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 202,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3.9446624136001114e-06,\n          0.2566085022431339,\n          0.4049586776859504\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

We concluded that there were indirect effects of disclosure intentions between privacy concerns and purchase intentions because the interval between the lower level of confidence interval (BootLLCI) and the upper level of confidence interval (BootULCI) did not include zero (see Table B.3). The results of the model fit (GFI = 0.98, AGFI = 0.96, CFI = 0.99, RMSEA = 0.03) indicated that there was good model fit between the proposed model and the data, such that the data does not require re-specification (see Table B.4).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Cosine_Similarity Score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.14368444431712876,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.5133287545573182,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 206,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.12453818453105654,\n          0.047250510740500976,\n          0.1649948738305144\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ROUGE-WE\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"float32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 214,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.6227190494537354,\n          0.8188688158988953,\n          0.5739125609397888\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"BertScore\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.024955950098645263,\n        \"min\": 0.7403626441955566,\n        \"max\": 0.8940659165382385,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 214,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.8206648826599121,\n          0.8106594681739807,\n          0.7824459671974182\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"BLEU Score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.17500341727587995,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.5495495495495496,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 202,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3.9446624136001114e-06,\n          0.2566085022431339,\n          0.4049586776859504\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"METEOR Score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": 0.17285269247886068,\n        \"max\": 0.9413632119514475,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 214,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.5475632117351862,\n          0.852095027274883,\n          0.6206349206349207\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
